# Docker 101 JSON API

Get started by running:

    docker-compose up -d

This will build and start the `api` and `webserver` containers in the background. You can access the sole API endpoint 
at [http://localhost/api/movies.json](http://localhost/api/movies.json) (substitute your Docker host address if it is
not `localhost`).
